# VCF Operations vCommunity Content 

This Aria Operations management pack lowers the knowledge barrier required to add your own content. While the MP Builder is better for quick and simple addition, a native management pack empowers you to build much more powerful features. 
With programming and API knowledge, you can do the following:
* Add your own object
* Add your own metrics and properties. They can have complex logic as it's all done in programming. Attach them into existing object.
* Add your own alerts, dashboards, reports. To override existing ones, simply use the same ID
* Add your own super metric. This is handy if you want your users to be able to customise the formula, as super metric is editable.
* Add your own widget. 

## System Requirements
```
* vSphere API version must be higher than 8.0.1.0 (vSphere 7.x versions are not supported)
* Aria Operations Manager 8.18. Advanced or Enterprise edition.
```

## Management Pack Service Account User Permission Requirements
```
* An account with read-only permission
* Propagate to children option must be selected
```
